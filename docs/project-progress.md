### Task Creation & Validation Feature Details

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All 6 implementation tasks (B1-B6) finished

**Files Created**:

**Backend Implementation**:
- `backend/src/models/task.model.js` - Task model with validation
- `backend/src/bot/commands/newtask.command.js` - /newtask command handler
- `backend/src/bot/callbacks/task-creation.callbacks.js` - Inline keyboard callbacks
- `backend/src/services/task-creation/task-creation.service.js` - AI parsing and validation service
- `backend/src/bot/formatters/task-creation.formatter.js` - Message formatting utilities

**Test Coverage**:
- `backend/tests/models/task.model.test.js` - Task model tests
- `backend/tests/bot/newtask.command.test.js` - Command handler tests
- `backend/tests/bot/task-creation.callbacks.test.js` - Callback handler tests
- `backend/tests/services/task-creation.service.test.js` - Service layer tests
- `backend/tests/bot/formatters/task-creation.formatter.test.js` - Formatter tests
- `backend/tests/bot/task-creation.test.js` - Integration tests
- `backend/tests/bot/command-handler.test.js` - Command routing tests

**Documentation**:
- `docs/features/task-creation-validation/spec.md` - Feature specification
- `docs/features/task-creation-validation/BOT-INTERACTIONS.md` - User flow documentation
- `docs/features/task-creation-validation/messages.md` - Bot message definitions
- `docs/features/task-creation-validation/tasks.md` - Task details and requirements
- `docs/features/task-creation-validation/task-prompts.md` - Implementation prompts
- `docs/features/task-creation-validation/TASK-LIST.md` - Task tracking
- `docs/features/task-creation-validation/CURRENT-STATE.md` - Progress tracking
- `docs/features/task-creation-validation/PROBLEMS-LOG.md` - Issue tracking

**Shared Code Created**:
- `shared/contracts/models/task.contract.js` - Task data contract
- `shared/contracts/models/user.contract.js` - User data contract
- `shared/contracts/models/base.contract.js` - Base contract utilities

**Key Learnings for Next Features**:

1. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test coverage (models, services, formatters, callbacks) ensures reliability. Each component has dedicated tests.

2. **Service Layer Pattern**: The task-creation service demonstrates good separation of concerns with AI parsing, validation, and business logic.

3. **Callback Management**: Complex inline keyboard flows require careful state management and user experience considerations.

4. **Message Formatting**: Dedicated formatters improve maintainability and ensure consistent UI across the bot.

5. **Contract System**: Shared contracts between frontend and backend ensure data consistency and type safety.

6. **Documentation Workflow**: The task-prompts.md approach provides clear implementation guidance and reduces development time.

7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling in services and proper user feedback improves reliability.

### Team Management Feature Details

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All 6 implementation tasks (B1-B6) finished

**Files Created**:

**Backend Implementation**:
- `shared/contracts/models/team.contract.js` - Team data contract with member structure
- `backend/src/models/team.model.js` - Team model with member schema and validation
- `backend/src/bot/commands/team.command.js` - /team command handler with inline menu
- `backend/src/bot/callbacks/team.callbacks.js` - Team callback handlers for all interactions
- `backend/src/services/team/team.service.js` - Team business logic with role-based permissions
- `backend/src/bot/formatters/team.formatter.js` - Team message formatting and keyboards

**Test Coverage**:
- `backend/tests/models/team.model.test.js` - Team model validation and database tests
- `backend/tests/services/team.service.test.js` - Service layer and permission tests
- `backend/tests/bot/team.test.js` - Integration tests for complete workflows
- `backend/tests/bot/formatters/team.formatter.test.js` - Message formatting tests

**Documentation**:
- `docs/features/team-management/spec.md` - Feature specification with role hierarchy
- `docs/features/team-management/BOT-INTERACTIONS.md` - User interaction flows
- `docs/features/team-management/messages.md` - Bot message templates and keyboards
- `docs/features/team-management/tasks.md` - Detailed task requirements
- `docs/features/team-management/task-prompts.md` - Implementation guidance (B1-B6)
- `docs/features/team-management/TASK-LIST.md` - Task tracking and dependencies
- `docs/features/team-management/CURRENT-STATE.md` - Progress tracking
- `docs/features/team-management/PROBLEMS-LOG.md` - Issue resolution log

**Shared Code Enhanced**:
- Enhanced `backend/src/bot/constants/messages.js` - Added team management messages
- Enhanced `backend/src/bot/index.js` - Added team callback routing and text input handling
- Enhanced `backend/src/utils/errors.js` - Validation error handling for team operations

**Key Learnings for Next Features**:

1. **Role-Based Permissions**: Implemented hierarchical permission system (admin > manager > member) with proper validation in service layer.

2. **State Management**: Text input handling for member addition requires careful state tracking and validation.

3. **Dynamic Callbacks**: Pattern matching for dynamic callback data (team_remove_username, team_confirm_remove_username) enables flexible UI flows.

4. **Service Integration**: Placeholder implementations in callbacks allow for incremental development while maintaining UI functionality.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: 61 tests across all layers ensure reliability - integration, unit, and edge case coverage.

6. **Database Design**: Member subdocuments with role enums and metadata provide flexible team structure.

7. **UI Consistency**: Formatter functions with role icons and consistent messaging improve user experience.

8. **Permission Validation**: Self-removal prevention for only admin and role hierarchy enforcement prevent security issues.
