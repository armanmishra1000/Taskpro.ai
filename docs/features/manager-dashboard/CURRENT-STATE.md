## Bot Commands:
<!-- List all commands created for this feature -->
- `/dashboard` - âœ… Implemented with permission validation and overview display

## Inline Keyboards:
<!-- List all keyboard layouts created -->
- Main dashboard navigation keyboard (Active Tasks, Velocity Metrics, Blocker Alerts, Overdue Tasks, Refresh Data)
- Section-specific keyboards for each dashboard section
- Navigation back buttons for seamless user experience

## Database Models Used:
<!-- Models from contracts this feature uses -->
- Task model (for active tasks, overdue tracking, velocity metrics)
- Team model (for team management, member queries)
- StandupResponse model (for team activity metrics)
- User model (for manager permissions, user queries)

## Model Optimizations Added:
<!-- Specific optimizations for dashboard performance -->
- Task model: Dashboard-specific indexes for team queries, status breakdowns, overdue analysis
- Task model: Helper methods for team metrics, velocity calculations, blocker alerts
- Team model: Manager permission validation, member management queries
- User model: Manager/admin filtering, team member queries
- StandupResponse model: Team activity metrics, participation rate calculations

## Services Created:
<!-- Service layer components -->
- ManagerDashboardService: Enhanced with caching, validation, and advanced metrics calculation
- Permission validation with proper error handling
- Cache management with 5-minute timeout
- Advanced metrics calculation for velocity, blockers, and overdue tasks
- Top performers analysis and trend calculations

## Callback Handlers Implemented:
<!-- Dashboard navigation and section handlers -->
- `dashboard_active_tasks`: Active tasks overview with status/priority breakdowns
- `dashboard_velocity`: Team velocity metrics and completion trends
- `dashboard_blockers`: Active blocker alerts grouped by impact
- `dashboard_overdue`: Overdue tasks analysis with urgency levels
- `dashboard_refresh`: Data refresh with timestamp confirmation
- `dashboard_main`: Return to main dashboard overview
- `dashboard_high_priority`: High priority tasks filtering
- Additional handlers for future expansion (critical blockers, performance reports, etc.)

## Formatters Created:
<!-- Message formatting components -->
- ManagerDashboardFormatter: Enhanced with visual indicators and professional formatting
- Status and priority icon mapping with consistent emoji usage
- Time formatting utilities (due dates, time ago, relative dates)
- Trend calculation for velocity metrics
- Impact and urgency indicators for blockers and overdue tasks
- Performance indicators with contextual feedback

## Service Layer Enhancements:
<!-- Advanced business logic and performance optimizations -->
- **Caching System:** 5-minute cache timeout for dashboard data
- **Permission Validation:** Proper error handling with ValidationError and UnauthorizedError
- **Advanced Metrics:** Enhanced velocity calculations, top performers analysis
- **Blocker Analysis:** Prioritized blocker sorting by impact and recency
- **Overdue Categorization:** Urgency-based task categorization (critical, high, medium)
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient aggregation pipelines and data filtering
- **Cache Management:** Automatic cache refresh and pre-warming capabilities

## Message Formatting Enhancements:
<!-- Professional formatting and visual indicators -->
- **Visual Indicators:** Consistent emoji usage for status, priority, impact, and urgency
- **Professional Layout:** Clean, organized message structure with proper spacing
- **Contextual Feedback:** Performance indicators and status messages
- **Enhanced Readability:** Clear section headers and organized data presentation
- **Empty State Handling:** Friendly messages for no-data scenarios
- **Error Message Enhancement:** Detailed, user-friendly error messages

## Integration Tests Created:
<!-- Comprehensive test coverage for dashboard functionality -->
- **Simple Integration Tests:** Core functionality tests for permission validation, formatters, and helpers
- **Service Layer Tests:** Focused tests for dashboard service methods and business logic
- **Permission Validation:** Tests for manager/admin access control and error handling
- **Message Formatters:** Tests for all formatting methods and keyboard generation
- **Helper Methods:** Tests for utility functions and edge case handling
- **Error Handling:** Tests for database errors, invalid inputs, and edge cases
- **Test Coverage:** 13 passing tests covering all major dashboard components
